Hi, 

I am a Ph.D. scholar in DR. Sharmistha Majumdarâ€™s group at Indian Institute Technology Gandhinagar. I work on jumping genes specifically a 'domesticated' one, THAP9. I am trying to explain the DNA binding and catalytic activity of THAP9, whose function is yet to be discovered.

In my Ph.D. journey so far, the ongoing quest for finding the unknowns of THAP-9 is challenging and I have enjoyed encountering them. The difficulties that I face on a daily basis and the knowledge I gain when I resolve them  are helping  me grow as a researcher. I want to use these skills to search for answers for the unknowns of transposition, its mechanism, its role in evolution, gene rearrangements and DNA repair.

## Personal 

I grew up in a punjabi family in a small town (Batala) in Punjab - northern India. I love food (cooking and eating), music, urdu poetry, movies and books. I am also a huge fan of Southpark. I have been very slothful about working out but recently I have started running and I aim to run a marathon some day :smile:.
