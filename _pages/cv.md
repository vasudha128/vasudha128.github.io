PhD Projects
====

* Comparison of online tools available for ChIP-exo data analysis (Completed and published).

In this study, we have compared the performance of popular peak callers on publicly
available ChIP-exo data of Glucocorticoid receptor. The tools were used with default
parameters to conclude which one works best without any modifications. We also addressed
how the quality of reads affects peak-calling.

* Identification of catalytic domain in human THAP9 transposase (Manuscript under
preparation). 

The human THAP9 protein is homologous (25% identical and 40% similar) to the Drosophila
P element transposase beyond its DNA binding domain. It is immobile in humans and exists
as a single copy gene. Although the function of THAP9 remains undiscovered, it is known to
be catalytically active and can cut DNA flanked by P element’s TIRs in human as well as
Drosophila cells. In this study we have investigated the presence of a DDE/D (Asp, Asp,
Glu/Asp) catalytic triad which enables THAP9 to break DNA strands.

* Genome-wide binding of THAP9 in human cells (Work in progress).

THAP9 is a ‘cut and paste’ DNA transposase homologous to the well studied Drosophila
P-element transposase. Interestingly, it is highly expressed in human embryonic stem cells
and testis. The THAP protein family is named after its unique C2CH DNA binding THAP
domain. However, the DNA binding location of THAP-9 is unknown. Our ChIP-exo data
analysis has revealed multiple binding sites of THAP-9 in nuclear as well as mitochondrial
DNA. In addition to the ‘CCC’ containing motif which is conserved in Drosophila, we have
found a repetitive DNA binding sequence in mitochondr
